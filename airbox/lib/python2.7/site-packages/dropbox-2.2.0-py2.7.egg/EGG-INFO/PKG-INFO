        - https://www.dropbox.com/developers/datastore/docs
        
        Setup
        -----
        
        You can install this package using ``pip``::
        
           $ pip install dropbox
        
        Getting a Dropbox API key
        -------------------------
        
        You need a Dropbox API key to make API requests.
        
        - Go to https://dropbox.com/developers/apps.
        - If you've already registered an app, click on the "Options" link to see the
          app's API key and secret.
        - Otherwise, click "Create an app" to register an app. Choose "Dropbox API"
          with datastore and/or file permissions depending on your needs.
          See https://www.dropbox.com/developers/reference#app-permissions.
        
        Using the Dropbox API
        ---------------------
        
        Full documentation:
        
        - https://www.dropbox.com/developers/core/docs
        - https://www.dropbox.com/developers/datastore/docs
        
        Before your app can access a Dropbox user's files, the user must authorize your
        application using OAuth 2.  Successfully completing this authorization flow
        gives you an "access token" for the user's Dropbox account, which grants you the
        ability to make Dropbox API calls to access their files.
        
        - Authorization example for a web app: example/flask_app/
        - Authorization example for a command-line tool:
          https://www.dropbox.com/developers/core/start/python
        
        Once you have an access token, create a DropboxClient instance and start making
        API calls.
        
        You only need to perform the authorization process once per user.  Once you have
        an access token for a user, save it somewhere persistent, like in a database.
        The next time that user visits your app, you can skip the authorization process
        and go straight to making API calls.
        
        Running the Examples
        --------------------
        
        There are example programs in the "example" folder.  Before you can run an
        example, you need to edit the ".py" file and put your Dropbox API app key and
        secret in the "APP_KEY" and "APP_SECRET" constants.
