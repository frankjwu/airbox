What Does Simple Crypt Do?
--------------------------

Simple Crypt encrypts and decrypts data.  It has two functions, ``encrypt``
and ``decrypt``::

    from simplecrypt import encrypt, decrypt
    ciphertext = encrypt('password', plaintext)
    plaintext = decrypt('password', ciphertext)

That's it.  You can see the implementation on
`github <https://github.com/andrewcooke/simple-crypt/blob/master/src/simplecrypt/__init__.py>`_.

Why Should I Use Simple Crypt?
------------------------------

* It uses standard, well-known algorithms, closely following the
  recommendations `here <http://www.daemonology.net/blog/2009-06-11-cryptographic-right-answers.html>`_.

* The established, efficient `pycrypto <https://www.dlitz.net/software/pycrypto>`_
  library provides the algorithm implementations (the cipher used is AES256).

* It includes a check (an HMAC with SHA256) to warn when ciphertext data are
  modified.

* It tries to make things as secure as possible when poor quality passwords
  are used (PBKDF2 with SHA256, a 256 bit random salt (increased from 128 bits
  in release 3.0.0), and 10,000 rounds).  But that doesn't mean you should use
  a poor password!

* Using a library, rather than writing your own code, means that we have less
  solutions to the same problem.  That means more chance of finding bugs, which
  means more reliable, more secure code.

* If simple-crypt does have a bug, the use of a header in the ciphertext data
  will help support an upgrade path (I can't promise full backwards support,
  because any solution will depend on the attack, but at least the needed
  information is present).

What Else Should I Know?
------------------------

* You must also install ``pycrypto``.  **Note** that pycrypto has parts
  written in C so requires a full python install.  On some unix systems that
  may mean adding a package like ``python-dev`` from your package manager.

* In Python 3 the outputs from ``encrypt`` and ``decrypt`` are ``bytes``.
  If you started with string input then you can convert the output from
  ``decrypt`` using ``.decode('utf8')``.

::

    mystring = decrypt('password', ciphertext).decode('utf8')


* Release 3.0.0 *can* decrypt data from previous versions, but data encrypted
  by 3.0.0 onwards *cannot* be decrypted by earlier code (instead, an
  error is raised asking the user to update to the latest version).
