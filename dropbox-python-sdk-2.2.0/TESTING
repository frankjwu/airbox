How to run the unittests
========================

*After some configuration*, you can run the tests with either py.test
or setup.py:

   py.test tests
   python setup.py test

If you want to run a subset of tests:

   py.test tests/test_client.py             (run just one file's tests)
   py.test tests -k test_set_request_token  (run just the named test)

Below are the steps needed to obtain the right configuration.

Common setup
------------

- Go to https://www.dropbox.com/developers/apps and click on Create
  App.  Select "Dropbox API app".  Select "Files and datastores".
  Select "Yes" (limited to its own, private folder).  Choose any app
  name you like.  Click "Create app".  You will need the App key and
  App secret from the page displayed on successful app creation.
  (If you already have a suitable app, you can get these values from
  the app's Options page.)

- chdir into the example directory.

- Edit cli_client.py to set APP_KEY and APP_SECRET to the values from
  the previous step.

OAuth2 setup
------------

Note that the access token may expire or be revoked.  You may have
to repeat the following steps occasionally.

- Still in the example directory, start the cli_client.py program as follows:

  PYTHONPATH=.. python cli_client.py

  This gives you a "Dropbox>" prompt.  Type "login" and follow the
  instructions.  Then exit the program (type ^D).  You now have a file
  token_store.txt containing the OAuth2 access token.

- Chdir one level up.

- Copy tests/oauth2.auth.example to tests/oauth2.auth

- Edit tests/oauth2.auth as follows:

  access_token: Copy the token from example/token_store.txt (dropping
                the "oauth2:" prefix).

OAuth1 setup
------------

Again, you have to repeat these steps if the token has expired.

- Chdir back into the example directory.

- Run the cli_client.py program again, this time typing "login_oauth1"
  and following the (slightly different) instructions.  This writes a
  different value to the token_store.txt file.

- Chdir back up.

- Copy tests/oauth1.auth.example to tests/oauth1.auth

- Edit tests/oauth1.auth as follows:

  app_key, app_secret: From the app creation page.

  access_key, access_secret: From the example/token_store.txt file, which should
                             have the following form: oauth1:ACCESS_KEY:ACCESS_SECRET

You are now ready to run the tests.
