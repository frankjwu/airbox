This is a simple Flask example app that shows how to link with a user's Dropbox
via the Python SDK.

How to use
----------

1. Edit the configuration in the simple_dropbox_app.py file. You'll need to set the
   DROPBOX_APP_KEY and DROPBOX_APP_SECRET to the app key and app secret of your
   Dropbox app.  Make sure to add http://127.0.0.1:5000/dropbox-auth-finish
   to the OAuth redirect URLs in your Dropbox app configuration.

2. Now you can run the simple_dropbox_app.py file with your python interpreter and
   the application will greet you on http://localhost:5000/.
